# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim config

This configuration now uses [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) as
it's base.

My previous config is still in the git history of this repo but was getting a
little bit difficult to keep up to date.

## Installation

```bash
brew install neovim
git clone git@github.com:stevenocchipinti/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
alias vim=nvim
```
